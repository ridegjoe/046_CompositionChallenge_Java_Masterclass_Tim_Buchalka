        // START OF CHALLENGE FOR COMPOSITION
        //
        // Create a single room of a house using composition.
        // Think about the things that should be included in the room.
        // Maybe physical parts of the house but furniture as well
        // Add at least one method to access an object via a getter and
        // then that objects public method as you saw in the previous video
        // then add at least one method to hide the object e.g. not using a getter
        // but to access the object used in composition within the main class
        // like you saw in this video.
        //
        // END OF CHALLENGE FOR COMPOSITION

        // The code with the solution is made by myself.
